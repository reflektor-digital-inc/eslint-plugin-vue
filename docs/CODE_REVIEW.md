# Code Review

## Everyone
* Give as much information you can.
* Good questions avoid judgment and avoid assumptions about the author's perspective.
* Ask for clarification. ("I didn't understand. Can you clarify?")
* Be explicit. Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.
* Avoid long threads of miscommunication, summarize or go to a call.

## Having Your Code Reviewed
* Follow the PR name conventions.
* A common axiom is "Don't take it personally. The review is of the code, not you."
* Explain why the code exists.
* Seek to understand the reviewer's perspective.
* Try to respond to every comment.

## Reviewing Code
* Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't.
* Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.
* Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. ("What do you think about using a
  custom validator here?")
* Seek to understand the author's perspective.
